## 🧠 Project Overview
Pipeline systems are vital for transporting oil and gas but remain vulnerable to leaks and failures that threaten the environment. 
Traditional monitoring techniques often lack real-time detection and predictive capabilities, leading to delayed responses and expensive damage. 
To address these challenges, this project leverages computer vision and deep learning to enhance pipeline surveillance. 
It focuses on developing an intelligent object detection model capable of extracting landmark features from images and UAV-acquired videos for real-time pipeline monitoring.

## 🔍 Research Objectives
- To curate a high-quality dataset suitable for training the intelligent object detection model.
- To develop an object detection model suitable for crude oil pipeline detection.
- To evaluate and assess the performance of the developed model in accurately detecting pipeline leaks under real-world conditions.
